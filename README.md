# Discord Tavern Style Pygmalion Chatbot
This is a discord bot that uses Pygmalion-6B and a KoboldAI url. The bot now supports json files and tavern cards and will change its name and image automatically. I plan on adding more features like group chat support, random messages, and the ability to comment on images you share.
